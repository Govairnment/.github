## What is Govairnment

**Govairnment** is a Citizen-to-Citizen (C2C) governance system where citizens earn **reputation** through verifiable contribution and use that reputation to propose, debate, simulate, and evolve policy.

Governance is treated as **engineering**, not politics.

An **AI President** runs policy simulations and produces transparent rationales.  
**AI Senators** challenge proposals.  
**AI Judges** resolve disputes with auditable precedent.

During the transition era, **Human Oracles (real humans)** act as distributed anchors for context, crisis validation, and failsafe intervention under explicit rules.
